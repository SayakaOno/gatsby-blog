My long vacation was finally over and I went back to work today.
We have the first co-op student in our team, which is exciting.

I knew that repositories for mobile app were created while I was away, so I started learning React Native. Although I am not the one who is working on the mobile app, I asked a senior developer to help me play around with the code and he said yes!!!

Since he joined, things have been changing little by little.<br/>
I hear terms that I have never heared before.<br/>
Discussions got complicated.<br/>

It is overwhealming -

In order not to give up on keeping up with those, I decided to output what I heared "today."

Yes, "what I heared."

I hope to write "what I learned" eventually, but I think it will be a good start and simplicity is important to keep things up.

Even though I mentioned only about work, I will also write about English.

## English

### "benefit"

It was interesiting to know that this word has two opposite meanings.

1. receive an advantage.
   <i>"the community would benefit from having the shopping mall"</i>
2. bring advantage to.
   <i>"the shopping mall would benefit the community"</i>
